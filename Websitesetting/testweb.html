  	Our Universe have innumerable things like Stars,Galaxies,Dwarf Planets,Black holes,Sun,
  	Moon and Various Solar system. Sun is the biggest Star in Our Solar system.Sun consists of
  <b>73%</b>
  Hydrogen
  <b>25%</b> 
   Helium and the rest are the oxygen, neon,iron and carbon.The very first planet Mercury is named after the 
  <strong>
  <q style="font-style:italic;">Roman deity</q>
  </strong>
  Mercury, messenger of Gods.
  Recently, NASA the space organisation have taken the first ever image taken from satellite of 'Black Holes'.The Black Holes are basically a place where the gravitational  pull is maximum in the universe. It's so powerful that
  	<i> even light energy cannot escape from that pull</i>. Means light that usually travel straight in  vacuum is bent and is pulled by Black Hole.
    Universe is the great subject to rouse the curiousity of one's mind.By looking at those twinkling stars the consiousness of conscience is triggered. And then one's mind take oneself to the various virtue's of one's life and bring the question one's existence.
    In solar system earth is the only planet which have life in it while other planets have various gases, sand and rocks.Each Planet have it's own moon.Nobody knows how life have came to an existence in earth. But there are some great mythological stories that put man's mind to do certain tasks. 'Religion' is the concept that methodically improves the mind working process. It's gives man a purpose to his livelihood, due various religion that have been brought itself by the man have led him in dialemma.

      <p><i>Next Big thing is, Big Bang---</i></p>
  <p>
    So here what a Big Bang is,The most scientific model is known as Big Bang Theory. The Universe is expanded from in which all the matter and energy of the universe was concentrated. Several independent experimental measurements support the expansion of space, more generally, the Big bang idea. Recent observation support the idea that this expansion that is happening is because of. Most of the matter in the universe is not detected by today's method. Tha's why it is named as 'dark matter'.

    Universe have alwawys fasinated us in every way, because nobody knows where the universe ends this is quite a big question ,isn't it ?
    so for the time being we would like to tell you a fact about saturn and earth 
    earth 1year is altogether equal to 1day on saturn !!!!!!!
    so this is new thing we are going to furnish your knowledge with such juicy tough tasty information.
      The earliest cosmological models of the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus' work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe.
    General relativity describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy (gravity). The topology or geometry of the Universe includes both local geometry in the observable universe and global geometry. Cosmologists often work with a given space-like slice of spacetime called the comoving coordinates. The section of spacetime which can be observed is the backward light cone, which delimits the cosmological horizon. The cosmological horizon (also called the particle horizon or the light horizon) is the maximum distance from which particles can have traveled to the observer in the age of the Universe. This horizon represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the Universe.The existence, properties, and significance of a cosmological horizon depend on the particular cosmological model.

An important parameter determining the future evolution of the Universe theory is the density parameter, Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. This selects one of three possible geometries depending on whether Ω is equal to, less than, or greater than 1. These are called, respectively, the flat, open and closed universes.
Observations, including the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and Planck maps of the CMB, suggest that the Universe is infinite in extent with a finite age, as described by the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) models.These FLRW models thus support inflationary models and the standard model of cosmology, describing a flat, homogeneous universe presently dominated by dark matter and dark energy.
